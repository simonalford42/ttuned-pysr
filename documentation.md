# Dataset generation and storage
Datasets are generated by generate_expressions.py and generate_traces.py. Then they are converted to data to train NN on with one_step_conversion.py. For example, final dataset to train NN on is datasets/training/gen1k_arith_1k_c05_20251003_135753_basic_train.jsonl, which corresponds to traces datasets/traces/gen1k_arith_1k_c05_20251003_135753.pkl.gz, which corresponds to expressions datasets/expressions/arith_1k_c05_20251003_135753.pkl.gz. Note that some metadata is stored in the traces and expressions file, which can be viewed with inspect_datasets.py. inspect_datasets.py will also show you what the examples look like.
