- Whenever completing a high level step, append a summary of what you did to agent_artifacts/history.md.
- I know you like to make lots of small scripts for things, markdown files for results, etc. I have a folder "agent_artifacts" for storing those files when they are not core parts of the codebase and more testing/documenting intermediate steps. I might ask you to move files there when I'm done with them.
- Always add default arguments to scripts so we can remember how data was created
