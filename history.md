## Refactored MinimalSR to BasicSR

Successfully refactored the MinimalSR class with the following changes:

1. **Renamed class**: Changed from `MinimalSR` to `BasicSR` in `minimal_sr.py`
2. **Added time limit functionality**: 
   - Added `time_limit` parameter to `__init__` method (defaults to None for no limit)
   - Added time tracking in `fit` method that stops evolution when time limit is reached
3. **Added MSE early stopping**: 
   - Added check for MSE <= 1e-31 to stop evolution when near-zero error is achieved
   - Prints stopping message when early termination occurs
4. **Updated all references**: Updated imports and class references in:
   - `time_comparison_simple.py`
   - `initial_vs_evolved.py` 
   - `time_comparison.py`
   - `collect_trajectories.py`

**Testing results**: 
- BasicSR correctly stops when MSE reaches zero on simple problems (y=x)
- BasicSR correctly respects time limits and finds good solutions within 15 seconds for harder problems (y=x²+1)
- Found expression `(1.0 * (1.0 + (x0 * x0)))` which is equivalent to x²+1 with MSE=0.000000

All functionality works as requested.

## File Reorganization and Updated Analysis

Successfully reorganized the codebase and ran updated analysis:

1. **File cleanup**: 
   - Deleted old `time_comparison.py`
   - Renamed `time_comparison_simple.py` to `time_comparison.py`
   - Renamed `minimal_sr.py` to `basic_sr.py`
   - Updated all import statements from `minimal_sr` to `basic_sr`
   - Deleted `minimal_sr_results.md`

2. **Updated time_comparison.py**:
   - Now uses BasicSR.fit() directly with time_limit parameter
   - Leverages built-in MSE early stopping (≤ 3e-16)
   - Population size set to 30 for good balance of speed and exploration
   - Updated to run each problem for 60 seconds (vs. previous 15 seconds)

3. **Analysis results (60 seconds per problem)**:
   - **pythagorean_3d**: Solved perfectly in 0.3s (MSE ≈ 7.45e-31)
   - **quadratic_formula_discriminant**: Solved perfectly in 1.1s (MSE ≈ 3.21e-31)  
   - **polynomial_product**: Solved perfectly in 0.0s (MSE ≈ 1.49e-31)
   - **compound_fraction**: Could not solve (MSE = 3.11e-02 after 8.9s)
   - **surface_area_sphere_approx**: Partial solution (MSE = 4.65e-01 after 19.5s)

4. **Key findings**:
   - Early stopping works effectively - most problems solved in <2 seconds
   - BasicSR successfully finds exact solutions for simpler mathematical relationships
   - More complex relationships (compound fractions, surface area approximations) remain challenging
   - The updated implementation properly uses both time limits and MSE thresholds
