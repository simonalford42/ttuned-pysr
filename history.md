## Cleaned Up Training Data Format (9/15/2025)

Removed unnecessary fields from training data to reduce file size and focus on essential information:

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed `fitnesses` array**: The individual fitness values for each expression in a generation are no longer stored in training data
2. **Removed `avg_fitness`**: Average fitness per generation is no longer computed or stored
3. **Kept essential fields**: Retained `best_fitness`, `best_expression`, `expressions`, `population_diversity` for analysis
4. **Preserved analysis capability**: BasicSR still computes fitnesses internally for analysis but filters them out when creating training datasets

### Implementation:
- Modified `generate_traces.py` to filter out `fitnesses` and `avg_fitness` when creating training datasets
- Updated `convert_trajectories.py` to handle missing fitnesses gracefully with dummy values
- Kept full fitness computation in `basic_sr.py` for runtime analysis and debugging

This reduces training file sizes significantly while preserving all information needed for neural model training.

## Updated Training Data Generation API (9/15/2025)

Updated the training data generation system to use simplified JSON formats as requested:

### Changes Made:
1. **Expressions format**: Changed from full objects with metadata to simple array of expression strings
   - Before: `{"expressions": [{"id": 0, "expression": "x+1", "variables": ["x0"], ...}, ...]}`
   - After: `{"expressions": ["x+1", "x*2", "x**2"]}`

2. **Traces format**: Changed from nested object structure to flat array
   - Before: `{"trajectories": {"expr_0": [trajectory_data], "expr_1": [...]}}`
   - After: `{"trajectories": [trajectory_data1, trajectory_data2, ...]}`

3. **Updated processing pipeline**: Modified `convert_trajectories.py` to handle the new flat array formats, including support for raw arrays extracted by dataset_manager.

4. **Verified end-to-end**: Successfully tested complete pipeline generating expressions → traces → training dataset with new formats.

### Files Updated:
- `generate_expressions.py`: Simplified expression output format
- `generate_traces.py`: Updated traces output to flat array, modified expression loading
- `training/convert_trajectories.py`: Added support for new flat array format detection and processing
- `dataset_manager.py`: Works correctly with new formats

## Implemented Training Data Generation System (9/12/2025)

Successfully implemented a complete training data generation system with three main components:

### 1. Expression Generator (`generate_expressions.py`)
- Generates synthetic polynomial expressions for training
- Configurable parameters: max degree, max variables, constants
- Supports reproducible generation with seed control
- Saves expressions with metadata and data generation functions

### 2. Trace Generator (`generate_traces.py`) 
- Runs BasicSR on expression datasets to collect evolutionary trajectories
- Integrates with existing `collect_trajectories.py` infrastructure
- Configurable BasicSR parameters (population size, generations, time limits)
- Saves complete trajectory data with metadata

### 3. Dataset Manager (`dataset_manager.py`)
- Manages end-to-end pipeline from expressions → traces → training data
- Converts traces to one-step prediction format using existing `convert_trajectories.py`
- Creates train/validation splits with configurable ratios
- Handles dataset versioning, validation, and metadata tracking

### Test Results
Created and validated test dataset `test_small`:
- 5 expressions, 10 generations each
- Generated 20 training examples (16 train, 4 val)
- Traces correctly capture population evolution between generations
- Training data format compatible with existing model training pipeline
- All data validation checks passed

The system successfully builds on existing infrastructure while providing proper dataset management and reproducibility.

## Enhanced Context System for Neural SR (9/12/2025)

Implemented rich context functionality to provide neural models with more informative data about the symbolic regression problems:

### Context Types
1. **Basic Context** - Traditional format: `x0,x1 | +,-,*,/ | 1.0,2.0` (22 chars)
2. **Rich Context** - Adds data statistics: basic + `STATS: range=[...] | mean=... | var=... | skew=... | monotonic=... | zeros=... | complexity=...` (~134 chars)
3. **SuperRich Context** - Rich + ASCII text plot: rich + `PLOT: [ASCII visualization]` (~568 chars)

### Rich Context Features
- **Data moments**: mean, variance, skewness of target values
- **Range information**: min/max values for inputs and outputs
- **Function characteristics**: monotonicity detection, zero crossings count
- **Complexity measure**: normalized total variation metric
- **ASCII plots**: Text-based visualization for 1D functions (superrich only)

### Implementation
- Enhanced `format_utils.py` with `compute_data_statistics()` and contextual formatting
- Updated `convert_trajectories.py` to support `--context_type` argument
- Added data context loading for problems requiring rich statistics
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing basic context

### Test Results
- Successfully converted trajectories with all three context types
- Context length scales appropriately: 22 → 134 → 568 characters
- ASCII plots render correctly for constant/linear/nonlinear functions
- Rich context provides meaningful statistical summaries of data

This enhancement allows neural models to incorporate problem-specific information during search, potentially leading to more intelligent expression suggestions.

## Refactored MinimalSR to BasicSR

Successfully refactored the MinimalSR class with the following changes:

1. **Renamed class**: Changed from `MinimalSR` to `BasicSR` in `minimal_sr.py`
2. **Added time limit functionality**:
   - Added `time_limit` parameter to `__init__` method (defaults to None for no limit)
   - Added time tracking in `fit` method that stops evolution when time limit is reached
3. **Added MSE early stopping**:
   - Added check for MSE <= 1e-31 to stop evolution when near-zero error is achieved
   - Prints stopping message when early termination occurs
4. **Updated all references**: Updated imports and class references in:
   - `time_comparison_simple.py`
   - `initial_vs_evolved.py`
   - `time_comparison.py`
   - `collect_trajectories.py`

**Testing results**:
- BasicSR correctly stops when MSE reaches zero on simple problems (y=x)
- BasicSR correctly respects time limits and finds good solutions within 15 seconds for harder problems (y=x²+1)
- Found expression `(1.0 * (1.0 + (x0 * x0)))` which is equivalent to x²+1 with MSE=0.000000

All functionality works as requested.

## File Reorganization and Updated Analysis

Successfully reorganized the codebase and ran updated analysis:

1. **File cleanup**:
   - Deleted old `time_comparison.py`
   - Renamed `time_comparison_simple.py` to `time_comparison.py`
   - Renamed `minimal_sr.py` to `basic_sr.py`
   - Updated all import statements from `minimal_sr` to `basic_sr`
   - Deleted `minimal_sr_results.md`

2. **Updated time_comparison.py**:
   - Now uses BasicSR.fit() directly with time_limit parameter
   - Leverages built-in MSE early stopping (≤ 3e-16)
   - Population size set to 30 for good balance of speed and exploration
   - Updated to run each problem for 60 seconds (vs. previous 15 seconds)

3. **Analysis results (60 seconds per problem)**:
   - **pythagorean_3d**: Solved perfectly in 0.3s (MSE ≈ 7.45e-31)
   - **quadratic_formula_discriminant**: Solved perfectly in 1.1s (MSE ≈ 3.21e-31)
   - **polynomial_product**: Solved perfectly in 0.0s (MSE ≈ 1.49e-31)
   - **compound_fraction**: Could not solve (MSE = 3.11e-02 after 8.9s)
   - **surface_area_sphere_approx**: Partial solution (MSE = 4.65e-01 after 19.5s)

4. **Key findings**:
   - Early stopping works effectively - most problems solved in <2 seconds
   - BasicSR successfully finds exact solutions for simpler mathematical relationships
   - More complex relationships (compound fractions, surface area approximations) remain challenging
   - The updated implementation properly uses both time limits and MSE thresholds

## Trajectory Collection System Implementation

Successfully implemented comprehensive trajectory collection system for BasicSR:

1. **Fixed collect_trajectories.py**:
   - Rewrote to use BasicSR.fit() instead of manual evolution loop
   - Now leverages built-in record_population_state() method for consistent data format
   - Generates rich trajectory data with full population information per generation
   - Replaced compound_fraction with mixed_polynomial to avoid local optima issues

2. **Enhanced BasicSR trajectory collection**:
   - Added collect_trajectory parameter to enable/disable trajectory recording
   - record_population_state() captures complete population state including:
     - All expressions and their fitnesses
     - Population diversity metrics
     - Best individual per generation
     - Average fitness statistics

3. **Configured for harder problems**:
   - Set up collection for 5 harder problems: pythagorean_3d, quadratic_formula_discriminant, polynomial_product, mixed_polynomial, surface_area_sphere_approx
   - Parameters: 60 seconds per problem, 2 runs per problem
   - Population size 20 for good trajectory granularity
   - Generates comprehensive metadata and summary statistics

4. **Data format standardization**:
   - Trajectory data now matches test_single_trajectory format
   - Contains complete population evolution history
   - Includes problem metadata, timing information, and final results
   - Saves both combined and individual problem trajectory files

5. **Verification results**:
   - Simple problems (y=x) solve in generation 0 due to MSE early stopping (correct behavior)
   - Complex problems show proper multi-generation evolution
   - Trajectory collection system generates rich training data for future ML models

The system is now ready to collect comprehensive evolutionary trajectory data for symbolic regression research and training purposes.

## 8/11 - Neural SR Framework Implementation
- Modified train_one_step.py to enable wandb via config file instead of command line flag
- Refactored BasicSR class to abstract population generation into generate_new_population() method
- Created NeuralSR class that uses trained transformer models for neural population generation
- Implemented robust fallback mechanisms when neural generation fails, allowing seamless comparison between BasicSR and NeuralSR

## 8/12 - Parallel Population Generation for NeuralSR
- Rewrote NeuralSR.generate_new_population() to generate all population members in parallel instead of sequentially
- Changed from generating one expression at a time in a loop to sampling N outputs simultaneously using num_return_sequences parameter
- Processing now happens in batch: single model.generate() call creates all needed expressions, then processes each generated output
- This significantly improves efficiency by reducing the number of model inference calls from population_size-1 to just 1 per generation

## 8/12 - Code Refactoring: Reusable Basic Evolution Method
- Created generate_child_via_evolution() method in BasicSR to eliminate code duplication
- Extracted the common pattern of tournament selection + crossover/mutation into a single reusable function
- Updated BasicSR.generate_new_population() to use the new method, making it more concise
- Updated all 3 fallback locations in NeuralSR to use the same method, ensuring consistent behavior
- The method accepts a configurable crossover_prob parameter (default 0.7) for flexibility

## 8/12 - NeuralSR Size Constraint Removal
- Updated NeuralSR well-formed checking logic to accept any successfully parsed neural-generated expression (no size constraints)
- NeuralSR still accepts max_size and max_depth parameters which apply to fallback evolution operations (crossover/mutation)
- This allows the neural model to generate expressions of any size while maintaining user control over fallback operation constraints

## 8/12 - Neural Comparison Parameter Alignment
- Updated neural_comparison.py to use the same max_size and max_depth parameters as collect_trajectories.py
- Changed from max_depth=3, max_size=10 to max_depth=4, max_size=15
- This ensures fair comparison between neural and basic SR using the same constraints that were used during trajectory collection

## 8/12 - Training Configuration Setup for Larger Model
- Renamed onestep-config.json to onestep-tiny.json for the existing tiny model configuration
- Created new onestep-s.json configuration for training a larger model using gpt-neo-s.json
- Key differences in onestep-s.json:
  - Uses gpt-neo-s.json model config (1024 hidden size, 16 layers vs 256 hidden size, 4 layers)
  - Reduced batch size from 4 to 2 per device to accommodate larger model memory requirements
  - Added gradient_accumulation_steps=2 to maintain effective batch size
  - Reduced learning rate from 5e-4 to 3e-4 for more stable training of larger model
  - Updated output directory to "training/checkpoints/onestep-s"

## 8/12 - Research Documentation Created
- Created comprehensive research-style markdown document (symbolic_regression_approach.md) explaining the symbolic regression approach
- Document includes formal problem definition with mathematical notation
- Details BasicSR algorithm with population initialization, evolution operations, and fitness function
- Explains NeuralSR algorithm including neural architecture, training data format, and neural population generation
- Provides experimental validation framework and key contributions of the hybrid approach

## 9/15 - Enhanced Context with Generation Numbers
- Modified format_context() in format_utils.py to include generation parameter as first argument
- Updated function documentation to describe the new generation parameter
- Updated all call sites across the codebase to pass generation numbers:
  - basic_sr.py: Updated format_context_and_population() and generate_new_population() methods to accept and pass generation
  - superrich_demo.py and test_context_system.py: Updated calls to use generation 0 for demo/test purposes
  - convert_trajectories.py: Updated to use loop index (generation number) when creating context
  - fine_grained_comparison.py: Updated to pass correct generation numbers
- This allows the neural model to understand which generation it's working on during training and inference
