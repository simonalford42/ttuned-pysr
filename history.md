## Refactored MinimalSR to BasicSR

Successfully refactored the MinimalSR class with the following changes:

1. **Renamed class**: Changed from `MinimalSR` to `BasicSR` in `minimal_sr.py`
2. **Added time limit functionality**: 
   - Added `time_limit` parameter to `__init__` method (defaults to None for no limit)
   - Added time tracking in `fit` method that stops evolution when time limit is reached
3. **Added MSE early stopping**: 
   - Added check for MSE <= 1e-31 to stop evolution when near-zero error is achieved
   - Prints stopping message when early termination occurs
4. **Updated all references**: Updated imports and class references in:
   - `time_comparison_simple.py`
   - `initial_vs_evolved.py` 
   - `time_comparison.py`
   - `collect_trajectories.py`

**Testing results**: 
- BasicSR correctly stops when MSE reaches zero on simple problems (y=x)
- BasicSR correctly respects time limits and finds good solutions within 15 seconds for harder problems (y=x²+1)
- Found expression `(1.0 * (1.0 + (x0 * x0)))` which is equivalent to x²+1 with MSE=0.000000

All functionality works as requested.

## File Reorganization and Updated Analysis

Successfully reorganized the codebase and ran updated analysis:

1. **File cleanup**: 
   - Deleted old `time_comparison.py`
   - Renamed `time_comparison_simple.py` to `time_comparison.py`
   - Renamed `minimal_sr.py` to `basic_sr.py`
   - Updated all import statements from `minimal_sr` to `basic_sr`
   - Deleted `minimal_sr_results.md`

2. **Updated time_comparison.py**:
   - Now uses BasicSR.fit() directly with time_limit parameter
   - Leverages built-in MSE early stopping (≤ 3e-16)
   - Population size set to 30 for good balance of speed and exploration
   - Updated to run each problem for 60 seconds (vs. previous 15 seconds)

3. **Analysis results (60 seconds per problem)**:
   - **pythagorean_3d**: Solved perfectly in 0.3s (MSE ≈ 7.45e-31)
   - **quadratic_formula_discriminant**: Solved perfectly in 1.1s (MSE ≈ 3.21e-31)  
   - **polynomial_product**: Solved perfectly in 0.0s (MSE ≈ 1.49e-31)
   - **compound_fraction**: Could not solve (MSE = 3.11e-02 after 8.9s)
   - **surface_area_sphere_approx**: Partial solution (MSE = 4.65e-01 after 19.5s)

4. **Key findings**:
   - Early stopping works effectively - most problems solved in <2 seconds
   - BasicSR successfully finds exact solutions for simpler mathematical relationships
   - More complex relationships (compound fractions, surface area approximations) remain challenging
   - The updated implementation properly uses both time limits and MSE thresholds

## Trajectory Collection System Implementation

Successfully implemented comprehensive trajectory collection system for BasicSR:

1. **Fixed collect_trajectories.py**:
   - Rewrote to use BasicSR.fit() instead of manual evolution loop
   - Now leverages built-in record_population_state() method for consistent data format
   - Generates rich trajectory data with full population information per generation
   - Replaced compound_fraction with mixed_polynomial to avoid local optima issues

2. **Enhanced BasicSR trajectory collection**:
   - Added collect_trajectory parameter to enable/disable trajectory recording
   - record_population_state() captures complete population state including:
     - All expressions and their fitnesses
     - Population diversity metrics
     - Best individual per generation
     - Average fitness statistics

3. **Configured for harder problems**:
   - Set up collection for 5 harder problems: pythagorean_3d, quadratic_formula_discriminant, polynomial_product, mixed_polynomial, surface_area_sphere_approx
   - Parameters: 60 seconds per problem, 2 runs per problem
   - Population size 20 for good trajectory granularity
   - Generates comprehensive metadata and summary statistics

4. **Data format standardization**:
   - Trajectory data now matches test_single_trajectory format
   - Contains complete population evolution history
   - Includes problem metadata, timing information, and final results
   - Saves both combined and individual problem trajectory files

5. **Verification results**:
   - Simple problems (y=x) solve in generation 0 due to MSE early stopping (correct behavior)
   - Complex problems show proper multi-generation evolution
   - Trajectory collection system generates rich training data for future ML models

The system is now ready to collect comprehensive evolutionary trajectory data for symbolic regression research and training purposes.
